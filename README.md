# visualCompiler
 VIsualCompiler aims to be an interactive web-based tool that demystifies the complex process of compilation. The project plans to visualize how a compiler transforms source code into Intermediate Representation (IR) and then into assembly code. Using D3.js for interactive visualizations, vIsualCompiler will help students, developers, and enthusiasts gain a clearer understanding of each stage in the compilation process. Whether you're new to compilers or looking to deepen your understanding, vIsualCompiler seeks to offer an engaging way to explore the compilation journey step-by-step.
